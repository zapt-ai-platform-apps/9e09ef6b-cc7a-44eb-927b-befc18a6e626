# Manage Deadlines

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. View your added deadlines under the **Your Deadlines** section.
2. To adjust a deadline, currently, you need to remove it and add a new one (Note: The app doesn't currently support editing deadlines).
3. To remove a deadline, this feature needs to be implemented (Note: Currently, the app doesn't support deleting deadlines).
4. After updating your deadlines, click the **Generate Schedule** button again to refresh your schedule.

**Important:** Adding the ability to edit and remove deadlines is planned for future updates.
